Code for: Bayesian Generalized Sparse Symmetric Tensor-on-Vector Regression 

Technometrics, 2021


We introduce a generalized Bayesian linear model for symmetric tensor responses and scalar predictors, incorporating low-rankness and group sparsity for efficiency and interpretability. The framework identifies key tensor nodes and cells linked to predictors while quantifying uncertainty. Theoretically, we show that the posterior predictive density converges to the true density at a near-optimal rate in Hellinger distance, depending on how the number of tensor nodes grow with the sample size.
